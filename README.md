# TruthShield-is-an-AI-powered-fake-news-misinformation-detector- 
*Timeline:* June 2025 – July 2025  
*Internship:* VCodez  

## Overview  
This project develops an **AI-powered deep learning system** to detect and classify fake news and misinformation from online sources using textual, linguistic, and social media features.  

The goal is to support **digital trust**, **media literacy**, and **responsible information consumption** by identifying false or misleading content early, reducing misinformation spread, and safeguarding society from its harmful effects.  

## Objectives  
- Develop robust NLP models for fake news detection.  
- Analyze linguistic & contextual cues to identify misinformation.  
- Leverage social media signals to enhance credibility scoring.  
- Promote digital trust through explainable and transparent predictions.  

## Key Features  
- **Deep Learning Architectures**: LSTM, BiLSTM, BERT, RoBERTa, and Transformer-based models.  
- **Data Integration**: Combined textual, linguistic, and social media metadata for holistic analysis.  
- **High Classification Accuracy**: Achieved strong performance in detecting misinformation.  
- **Credibility Scoring**: Provided trust scores and feature explanations for flagged content.  
- **Explainability (XAI)**: Integrated model interpretation for public and media trust.  

## Project Structure  
- data/ → Datasets (news articles, social media posts)
- notebooks/ → Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing, modeling, evaluation
- models/ → Trained NLP models and weights
- scripts/ → Training & testing pipelines (Python scripts)
- results/ → Metrics, confusion matrices, plots, reports
- app/ → Flask-based web application for fake news detection


## Technologies Used  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Deep Learning:** LSTM, BiLSTM, BERT, RoBERTa, Transformers  
- **Web App:** Flask  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, GitHub  

## Results  
- Achieved **high accuracy** in fake news and misinformation classification.  
- Improved detection of **linguistic & contextual patterns** in text.  
- Provided **explainable trust scores** for better transparency.  
- Contributed to **combating misinformation** and improving media credibility.  

## Future Work  
- Incorporate larger & multilingual datasets for broader coverage.  
- Explore **Explainable AI (XAI)** for enhanced interpretability.  
- Develop **real-time detection** with lightweight models (DistilBERT, MobileBERT).  
- Adopt **Federated Learning** for privacy-preserving training on distributed datasets.  


## Installation & Setup (Jupyter Notebook)

You can run this project locally using **Jupyter Notebook**.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/swathiisekar/TruthShield-is-an-AI-powered-fake-news-misinformation-detector-.git
cd TruthShield-is-an-AI-powered-fake-news-misinformation-detector-

2. Create and activate virtual environment
